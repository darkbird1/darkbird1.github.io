I am currently working as a Scientist in Signal and Image Processing Group at Space Applications Center (SAC), Ahmedabad. My research interest broadly spans the application of Artificial Intelligence to solve computer vision problems, including Image and Video Compression and Spatio-spectral Super-Resolution. I am also interested in studying and utilizing the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning to explain and assess the behaviour of neural networks. Other than computer vision, I am also interseted in general sciences, especially Physics. Out of my curiosity, I also explore the connection of neural nets to physical principles.

Prior to joining SAC, I graduated with Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/sooraj.r">Dr. Deepak Mishra</a> during my undergraduate research in the field of Deep Video Compression. I also spent some time working with <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/deepak.mishra">Dr. Sooraj R.</a> to study the convergence behaviour of particles' energies in excited quantum wells (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9013855">Link here</a>).
